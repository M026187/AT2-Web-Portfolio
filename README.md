Your supervisor has assigned you the task of creating a knowledge resource website on the minerals mined in Western Australia. 

The web site has the following requirements.   

Pages to include: 

Home page to introduce the concept of and importance of mining in Western Australia. 

A page to list the minerals mined in Western Australia. At least 10. 

A page to list the 10 largest mine employers in Western Australia and the minerals they mine. Include a link to the company website. 

For each of the 3 largest employers a page which outlines the location of each of their mining locations in Western Australia. This is opened from the previous page. 

A company director popup from the previous page which appears when a link is clicked with the name, title, and photo along with a short bio of the CEO. 

A page for a contact form for people to ask for more development work to be done on specific companies and their mining interests. Your part of this is to create and layout the form. Submission of the form will add the information to a provided database. 
This page will also have an iframe which will have a table generated from the database with an updated request list so users can see what has already been requested. 

Develop a JavaScript to validate the input of the page when the Submit button is clicked. 

Your lecturer will act as your supervisor in each case. 

You may collaborate with other students to research the required information. 

You may use search engines and ChatGPT to generate content for the website (include cite attribute references to tools used) but coding layout must be your own work. 

You need to ensure that you follow professional work standards and job role requirements in the performance of the project.
